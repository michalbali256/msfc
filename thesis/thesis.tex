\section*{Attachment A - the Enclosed CD}
\label{attachment}
On the CD attached to this thesis we enclose the source codes of ns-3.28 with implemented MSFC and ns-3 simulation used to evaluate the traffic scheduler together with simple scripts that analyse the results and produce plots used in the thesis.

The electronic version of this thesis is also enclosed.
