This thesis is dedicated to all those who systematically try to overcome cognitive biases that
make them underestimate the need for proper caution and security, the biases that make them
\emph{not paranoid enough}.

I would also like to thank my supervisor Mirek Kratochvíl, who invested his time to introduce me into this
interesting problem, which also led me to study the beautiful theory behind it.

\section*{Attachment A - the Enclosed CD}

On the CD attached to this thesis (and on the online Thesis Repository of Charles University \cite{TRepo}) we enclose
the source codes of the implemented software together with the source codes of its
dependencies (GNU Nettle and GMP), and also the code of the SIDH Library, so it can
be used for comparison when benchmarking.

The electronic version of this thesis is also enclosed.
